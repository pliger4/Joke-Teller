# Joke-Teller

This is a simple training app based on HTML, CSS, JS and 2 APIs - Joke API and Voice RSS Text-To-Speech API.

- Upon clicking on a button GET request is sent to the Joke API resulting in a received JSON object with a joke string.
- Joke is sent via the POST request to the Voice RSS Text-To-Speech API.
- A response is received as an audio and inserted into the audio HTML element which is hidden.
